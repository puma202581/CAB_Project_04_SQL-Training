# CAB_Project_04_SQL-Training
Training files from DB Browser for SQLite
During two weeks at Code Academy Berlin, I worked autonomously on various exercises from the Learning Management System.
In total there were ten groups of tasks with different levels of complexity. 
The main goal was to getting to know and use SQL.
I applied different concepts (CTE, Subquery, Window, Concatenate, Auto-increment, etc.).
I also used dbdiagram.io to replicate the entity relationship diagrams (ERD) used in task 5.
